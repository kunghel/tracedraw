//! Strokes of the shaping brushes (Smooth, Smear, Twirl, Attract and
//! Repel, Smudge, Roughen): a drag over the selected objects reshapes the
//! curves under the nib, step by step, the whole stroke one undo step.
//! Brushes change only what is selected: with nothing selected a drag
//! does nothing and a click selects (#271). Objects that are
//! not curves are converted first. The settings come from the property bar
//! (`ui::brush_bars`).
//!
//! Twirl and Attract and Repel go on while the button is held still.
//! Held in one place, Attract and Repel work from the outline as the
//! hold found it ([`StrokeBase`]) with the dose held so far, so they
//! pull or push at a steady rate and come to rest once the dose is full;
//! a move starts afresh from the outline as it is. Roughen works out the
//! whole stroke from the outline it started from and the way the nib
//! went, so going over the same place again adds no nodes.
//!
//! The nib is sized on the drawing too: a drag that starts with Shift
//! held sizes it instead of brushing (right grows it, left shrinks it,
//! the circle showing where the press was), and the wheel over the
//! drawing sizes it a notch at a time with Shift held (Alt held when the
//! wheel scrolls instead of zooming, where Shift+wheel scrolls sideways).
