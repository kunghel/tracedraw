//! Keeps the rasterized page as an egui texture, re-rendering only when the
//! document, view, canvas size or drag preview changed. While the view
//! moves (a pan, a scroll, a zoom) the last render is shown shifted or
//! scaled into place and the page is rendered anew once the view has
//! rested for a moment, so a page of thousands of objects pans smoothly.
//! A page that takes long to draw is drawn on a thread of its own: the
//! window keeps answering, showing the last picture moved into place,
//! until the new one is ready (#345).
//!
//! A zoom on the main canvas does not wait for the view to rest: the
//! last picture, scaled, looks blurry, so the page is rendered for the
//! new zoom on a thread at once. A zoom step that comes while that render
//! runs does not restart it: its picture is taken when ready (closer to
//! the zoom shown than the one before) and the next render starts at once
//! for the latest zoom, so a burst of wheel notches shows a sharper
//! picture every render and the last one about a render after the last
//! step.
