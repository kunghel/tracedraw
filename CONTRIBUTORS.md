# Contributors

TraceDraw was created by Ighor Toth, its founder and lead maintainer, and
is written by its maintainers with Claude Code as co-author (see the
README). These people contributed code that is part of TraceDraw. Thank
you!

Everyone whose code is merged also appears in GitHub's contributor list:
when a contribution was recorded under another name (for example by the
coding assistant the contributor used), it is re-applied under the
contributor's own GitHub identity.

## Testing and reports

program help just as much; they are thanked in the issues and in
