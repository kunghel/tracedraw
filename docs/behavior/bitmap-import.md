# Bitmap import

File > Import (Ctrl+I) of a PNG, JPEG, BMP, GIF, TIFF or WebP file
embeds the image as a bitmap object centred on the page and remembers
the file (Bitmaps > Update from Link reads it again).

## The bitmap editor

Edit Bitmap writes the picture to a PNG in the temporary folder, links
the object to it and opens it in the bitmap editor set in Tools >
Options > Global > File Locations (a program file: `gimp`, its `.exe` on
Windows, or an application bundle on macOS, opened with `open -a`;
Browse picks it, Clear empties it). Empty, the default, opens it with the
system's program for PNG files (#593, `export::tests::the_bitmap_editor_gets_the_file`).
The browser build has no outside editor.

## Linked files follow their changes

A linked bitmap (an imported file, or one sent to the system image
editor by Edit Bitmap) follows its file on the desktop: once a second
the files' modification times are read, and a bitmap whose file changed
since it was last seen is read again on the spot, as Update from Link
does (`App::watch_linked_bitmaps`; one undo step per change, the status
bar says "Bitmap updated from its file"). So a save in the outside
editor shows in the drawing at once. A file seen for the first time is
only remembered; a file that cannot be read is left alone. The browser
has no files to watch
(`clipboard::linked_watch_tests::a_linked_bitmap_is_read_again_when_its_file_changes`).

## Size

The bitmap comes in at the resolution its file records, so a 300 dpi
scan 1200 pixels wide is 101.6 mm wide:

| Format | Where the resolution comes from |
|---|---|
| PNG | the `pHYs` chunk, when its unit is the metre (pixels per metre x 0.0254) |
| JPEG | the JFIF header's density in dots per inch or per centimetre; else the EXIF `XResolution`/`YResolution` with their `ResolutionUnit` |
| TIFF | `XResolution`/`YResolution` with `ResolutionUnit` (inch or centimetre) |
| BMP | the header's pixels per metre |

Width in mm = pixels x 25.4 / horizontal dpi, height likewise with the
vertical dpi. A file that records no resolution, only an aspect ratio,
or a value outside 1 to 100000 dpi comes in at 96 dpi. Pasted images
and generated pictures are placed at 96 dpi.

## On screen and in exports

A picture is decoded once and kept (`crates/render/src/image_cache.rs`,
512 MB of decoded pixels in the desktop build, 256 MB in the browser;
the least recently drawn go first). Drawn at less than half its pixels'
size, it is drawn from a reduced copy instead: level `k` halves the
sides `k` times, each pixel the average of the four beneath it, and the
level used is `floor(log2(1 / s))` for `s` screen pixels per picture
pixel (at most 12), so it is sampled at between half and the whole of
its size. The reduced copies share the same memory budget and are made
when first needed. An upright picture (not turned or slanted) covers
whole pixels: its edges are rounded to the nearest pixel boundary, so
pictures laid side by side meet without a pale seam (#853,
`band_tests::pictures_side_by_side_meet_without_a_seam`,
`band_tests::a_picture_drawn_small_shows_the_average_of_its_pixels`).

## Checks

- Each reader gives the stored value and nothing for missing, broken or
  out-of-range data (`image_dpi::tests`).
- Given a PNG of 4 pixels at 300 dpi, when imported, then it is
  4 x 25.4 / 300 mm wide; a PNG without `pHYs` is 4 x 25.4 / 96 mm wide
  (`image_dpi::tests::import_places_a_bitmap_at_its_resolution`).
