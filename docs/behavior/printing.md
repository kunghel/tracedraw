# Printing

File > Print (Ctrl+P) builds a print-ready PDF of the sheets and sends
it to the printer chosen in the dialog, or opens it in the system
viewer, where the printer is chosen (in the browser the PDF is
downloaded; on Android it goes to the system's print service, whose
dialog chooses the printer, the copies and the paper, #1398).
`export::print` builds it; the sheets come from `imposition.rs`.

## Printers

The Printer list holds the system's printers in name order (ignoring
case; the default stays where its name puts it), then "System printer
(through the PDF viewer)", "PDF file" and "PostScript file". The list
is read off the interface's thread when the dialog opens (on Android
there is no list: the print service lists the printers, and the entry
reads "System printer (through the Android print service)"), so a print
server that is slow to answer never holds the window: until it comes,
the list read last shows (or "Looking for printers..." the first
time, when Print waits for the list if a printer is the destination),
and the dialog takes the new list as soon as it is read, keeping a
destination picked meanwhile unless it names a printer the system does
not have (#614).
The printers come from CUPS (Linux and macOS): `lpstat -l -p -d` lists
them with their state, description and location (`printers.rs`,
`parse_lpstat`), and a print on one of them hands the PDF to `lp -d`
with the number of copies and their collation (`lp_args`) and the
drawing's name as the job title; the status bar says "Sent to printer
name", or what `lp` complained about. The dialog starts on the printer
printed to last when the system still has it, else on the default
printer, selected where it stands in the list, else on the PDF viewer
(`starting_printer`); the printer is
remembered with the other print choices (Options > Global > Printing).
On Windows the printers are every printer Windows has, the ones
installed on the computer and the network printers connected for the
user alike: PowerShell lists `Win32_Printer` when the dialog opens
(`WINDOWS_LIST`, `parse_windows_list`, #614) with each printer's
PrinterStatus and WorkOffline (Ready, Printing, Warming up, Stopped,
Offline, else Unknown), Location and Comment. A
print on one of them draws each sheet at the printer's own resolution
(its current setting, read through PowerShell before the sheets are
drawn, `parse_windows_resolution`; the finest it offers when the setting
is a named quality such as High; kept between 300 and 1200 dpi, 600
when the printer does not say; `windows_print_dpi`), so fine lines and
small text print as sharp as the PDF sent through `lp` on macOS and
Linux (#1404; before, every Windows print was a 300 dpi picture). Each
sheet goes as strips of at most 16 million pixels, every strip cut to
its part that is not white and left out when it is all white
(`sheet_tiles`), so a sheet never needs one huge picture in memory and
blank paper adds nothing to the job. Each strip is drawn with rows of
margin above and below, as far as shadow blurs reach (the whole sheet
when it has a lens), and starts on a multiple of 16 rows
(`render_page_rows`), so outlines leave no marks where strips meet. The strips are drawn pixel for
pixel when the printer's resolution is the one they were drawn at, else
smoothed, with their edges never blended with the paper, so strips meet
with no seam. With General > Print as bitmap the sheets go at the
resolution chosen there. The pictures reach the printer through
PowerShell's printing classes (`windows_print_script`), so no PDF
program is needed: each sheet takes
the printer's paper of its size when the printer has one (either way
round, within 2 mm), a wide sheet turns the paper, and the sheet is
drawn at its size from the paper's corner; the copies and their
collation go to the printer, the drawing's name is the job title. The
script runs without a window and shows no "Printing page" box, and gives
up after five minutes; what came of each print (the sheets sent, or the
error) is written to `tracedraw.log`. A one-sheet print used to fail
before it reached the printer, on every printer: the list of sheet sizes
flattened in PowerShell when it held one sheet (#614; checked on a
Windows machine with a printer writing to a file: one and two sheets
come out). In the browser the list has no printers and the print goes
through the PDF viewer.

Next to the list a Properties button (a gear, available when a system
printer is chosen) opens the printer's own settings: on Windows its
printing preferences (`rundll32 printui.dll,PrintUIEntry /e /n name`),
on macOS the system's Printers & Scanners settings, on Linux and other
CUPS systems the printer's page of the CUPS web interface in the browser
(`http://localhost:631/printers/name`, a web page, not a system dialog;
`properties_command`). Under
Orientation, Status, Location and Comment show what the system says of
the printer chosen (empty for the PDF viewer and the files, #614).

## Print dialog

Tabs: General, Color, Composite, Layout, Prepress, PostScript and the
preflight's Issues ("No Issues" or the count; hidden when Options >
Global > Printing turns the preflight off). Under them Print Preview
(hands the settings to the preview), Print, Cancel and Apply (keeps the
settings as Options > Global > Printing's). The dialog starts with those
preferences, and with the drawing's own bleed as the bleed limit when it
has one.

- General:
  - Destination: Printer is one of the system's printers (above), the
    system PDF viewer (which owns the printer and the copy count; in the
    browser the PDF is downloaded), a PDF file or a PostScript file (saved
    where chosen). Orientation: Match orientation (the Layout tab's
    Landscape box), Portrait or Landscape, for fixed sheets.
  - Sheet: the page's own size, the standard sizes, Smart Board 16:9
    (1354.582 x 762 mm) and Custom (width and height typed; the last one
    is kept). A Custom size saved with a name joins the list for the next
    time (Options keeps them, #591).
  - Print range: Current document, Current page, Pages (a list such as
    `1-3, 5, 8-`; an empty or unusable list prints them all), Selection
    (the selected objects of the current page, alone: no other object,
    nothing of the master layers, no page background; the area they cover,
    outlines and live effects included, becomes the page printed, so the
    sheet sized to the page is that area, a fixed sheet gets it centred
    at its size, shrunk only when it does not fit and Keep page size is off,
    and the layouts repeat it; #1001, `selection_as_page`,
    `export::tests::the_selection_prints_alone_on_a_page_of_its_size`,
    `export::tests::keep_size_keeps_the_selection_at_its_size`); and Odd and even pages,
    Odd pages or Even pages of the document or the list (#951).
  - Copies: a file gets its copies inside, as whole sets (Collate) or
    each sheet repeated. Reverse order (under Collate) prints the
    sheets last first, for a stack that comes out face up or for the
    backs of printed sheets; it reverses the sheets as imposed, so a
    booklet or n-up layout keeps its sheets whole (#1394, #1571).
  - Print as bitmap: each sheet becomes one picture at the resolution
    given (36 to 1200 dpi).
- Color: Composite, with Grayscale under it, or Separations (one grey
  page per ink and sheet: C, M, Y, K, then the spot inks; black = full
  ink). Grayscale (#1657) prints every colour of the sheets as its grey,
  its luminance `0.299 R + 0.587 G + 0.114 B` as Bitmaps > Mode >
  Grayscale gives it: fills, outlines, text, gradients, meshes, patterns,
  live effects, shadows, lens colours and the marks (registration colour
  stays), and every picture as its grey pixels (a CMYK picture's own
  inks are left out of the print); the drawing keeps its colours. It is
  greyed with Separations, which print from the colours. A lens that
  makes colours of its own from what lies under it (heat map) still
  does (`export::tests::grayscale_and_reverse_order_change_the_printed_sheets`).
  Convert spot colors to
  CMYK prints spot inks as their CMYK mix at their tint. The printed
  sheets keep the drawing's list of spot inks, so each spot ink gets its
  plate and its box in the print preview; before, the sheets lost the
  list and only the four process plates printed (#779,
  `export::tests::separations_print_a_plate_for_each_spot_ink`).
  Pictures are split into their inks too (#1659): a picture that keeps
  its ink channels (a CMYK image of a `.cdr` file) prints each ink as it
  holds it, so cyan ink alone prints on the cyan plate alone and black
  ink alone on the black plate; any other picture (RGB, greyscale, or
  made CMYK by Convert Colors or Image > Mode, whose pixels changed) has
  its pixels converted to CMYK with the drawing's colour management, the
  conversion vector colours take: RGB red prints magenta and yellow, a
  grey picture black ink alone (while neutral greys go to black). A spot
  channel prints on its spot plate. Each pixel keeps its alpha on every
  plate, so transparency, masks and clip frames print as they show.
  Channels kept from a file belong to the pixels they came with: once
  the pixels change (an effect, a mode, a resample) the pixels are
  converted instead, and Convert Colors to RGB drops them. A picture is
  split once per print job and its plates are cached, so Print Preview
  redrawing a plate does not split it again
  (`export::tests::separations_split_pictures_into_their_inks`). Before,
  pictures printed whole on every plate.
- Composite: Print text in black (fills, outlines and character colours
  of every text); Always overprint black (100 % black fills and outlines
  overprint).
- Layout: As in document, Fit to page or Scale (percent). Fit to page
  also brings objects that run off the page inside it: the objects the
  page shows (every printed one when the range is the selection) shrink
  as one to fit it, centred, when they do not fit; objects wholly off the
  page stay out (#534, `fit_contents_to_page`,
  `export::tests::fit_to_page_shrinks_what_runs_off_the_page`). Choosing
  Fit to page (here, or ticking it in Print Preview) also puts back a
  page moved or stretched on the sheet in Print Preview: the artwork
  position goes to 0 and the stretch to 100 %, so the page comes back
  fitted on the sheet (#1577,
  `print_preview::tests::fit_to_page_brings_a_dragged_page_back`). Bleed limit
  (how far beyond the page objects print, 4 mm by default); the
  imposition, sheet, gap, the paper margins (left, right, top, bottom,
  the same as Print Preview's; #909) and the sketch (below).
- Prepress: Invert and Mirror (the whole sheet, marks included; Invert
  prints a negative, the sheet's empty paper black too, so black ink
  shows clear rather than white on white paper,
  `export::tests::black_text_prints_black_and_a_negative_blackens_the_sheet`); Print
  file information (with its text, the drawing's name when left empty)
  and Print page numbers (each page's number under it); Crop/fold marks;
  Registration marks; Color bars and Densitometer scale.
- PostScript: with a PostScript file as the destination, the language
  level written in its header (2 or 3).
- Issues: what the preflight finds, and the way to its dialog.

## Print Preview

File > Print Preview, or Print Preview in the Print dialog (which hands
over its settings), fills the window with the sheets exactly as Print
sends them: the imposition, the marks, Mirror and Invert, built by the
same function (`export::print_sheets`).

- The printer's unprintable edge (#1924): with a printer chosen (not a
  file), the strip along each side of the sheet that the printer cannot
  print on, its hard margins as the system reports them, is shaded
  grey; when the artwork of a page (what its frame on the sheet shows,
  marks aside) reaches into it, a warning over the sheet says it will
  be cut off (`print_preview::art_in_unprintable_edge`). The margins
  are read once a printer, off the interface's thread (`printers.rs`,
  `MarginsCache`): on Windows the printer's default paper and its
  printable area (`PageSettings.PrintableArea`, hundredths of an inch,
  the paper upright; `parse_windows_margins`), through CUPS (Linux,
  macOS) the PPD's `*ImageableArea` inside its `*PaperDimension` for the
  paper `lpoptions` says the printer is set to, else the PPD's default
  (`parse_ppd_margins`); a queue with no PPD (driverless) or a printer
  that does not say gets no shading. A sheet wider than tall takes the
  margins turned a quarter counterclockwise: its top is the paper's
  left edge (`HardMargins::for_sheet`). The browser and Android have
  none.

- Top bar: Print (prints these settings and closes), the sheet shown with previous and next (Page Up, Page Down), Zoom from 25 to 400 % of the fitted size
  with Fit, the printer, and Close (Esc) at the right end (#534). The
  bar wraps onto a second row when the window is too narrow for it.
- The printer sits in the top bar after Fit, as in the Print dialog's
  General tab (the system's printers in name order, the PDF viewer, PDF
  and PostScript files; read off the interface's thread when the preview
  opens, the list read last shown meanwhile), with the gear button that
  opens the chosen printer's own Properties, its status, and the number
  of copies with Collate; it was at the top of the left panel, which now
  keeps that room for the options (#953). Print in the top bar prints
  there (#792,
  `print_preview::tests::the_preview_offers_the_printer_and_the_copies`).
- Left: the Print dialog's options, two to a row (#951,
  `print_preview::tests::the_options_stand_two_to_a_row`): All pages
  beside Current page, Pages (a list such as `1-3, 5`) beside Selection
  (with objects selected), Fit to page (or the scale) beside Odd and even
  pages, Odd pages or Even pages (for all pages or the list; the current
  page and the selection print as they are, and a choice that leaves no
  page is let go; the Print dialog's Print range has the same choice,
  `print_preview::tests::the_preview_prints_the_pages_chosen`); then
  Prepress: Print separations, Bleed with its limit (the Print dialog's
  Bleed limit, the same setting: 0 to 50 mm, greyed while Bleed is off,
  #1653, `print_preview::tests::the_bleed_limit_is_set_beside_bleed`)
  beside Crop marks, Registration
  marks beside Color bars, Densitometer scale beside Page information,
  Mirror beside Invert, Grayscale beside Reverse order (#1657, #1394),
  Transform and Artwork position; then the layout
  with its sketch. Every change rebuilds the sheets at once.
  The panel is 360 points wide at first and its edge drags from 300 to
  720. It is never narrower than its widest row as last laid out (a
  longer language, Repeat's rows), up to half the window, so no label
  is cut at its right; past half the window what does not fit scrolls
  sideways, and the panel scrolls down when it is taller than the window
  (#862, `print_preview::tests::the_options_panel_is_wider_and_its_edge_drags`,
  `print_preview::tests::no_option_is_cut_off_in_any_language`).
  While Print separations is on, a box for cyan, magenta, yellow, black
  and each spot ink stands indented under it, side by side in a row that
  wraps at the panel's edge, all ticked at first
  (#571, #1737; `print_preview::tests::the_ink_boxes_stand_under_print_separations`).
  Every ink ticked shows the sheet as it is; one alone shows its plate
  in grey; some show the colours those inks print together (process
  colours keep the channels ticked, a spot colour shows when its ink is
  ticked and is paper otherwise;
  `print_preview::tests::plates_split_the_sheet_by_ink`). Pictures follow
  the ticked inks pixel by pixel (#1659,
  `print_preview::tests::plates_split_pictures_by_ink`).
  The arrows (and Page Up / Page Down) then page through each plate of
  the sheet after it, one page per ticked ink as File > Print sends them,
  the plate's name beside the sheet number: the sheet with the ticked
  inks together, then Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black and each spot ink, in
  grey or, with "Show one ink in its color", in the ink's colour; an
  unticked ink has no page (#2379,
  `print_preview::tests::separations_preview_a_page_per_plate`). Before,
  the preview showed only the inks together, never a page per plate.
- A plate shows the ink's coverage in grey, black = full ink, as the
  separations print; registration colour shows on every plate. So cyan
  ink ticked alone shows a pure cyan square black, which reads as black
  ink on the cyan plate. "Show one ink in its color" (under the ink
  boxes, off at first) shows one ink alone as the colour it prints, the
  way several inks show: the cyan square cyan, what the ink does not
  print paper white. It changes the preview only; the plate prints the
  same (#1652,
  `print_preview::tests::one_ink_alone_shows_in_its_colour_when_asked`).
- Paper margins (left, right, top, bottom, mm, 0 at first) keep the
  paper's edges clear: the pages and their marks go in the middle of what
  is left, shrinking to fit inside it unless Keep size is on; a sheet
  fitted to the pages grows by them (`imposition::tests::pages_sit_inside_the_paper_margins`).
  They are typed in the left panel (with the layout, as on the Print
  dialog's Layout tab) or set by dragging their dashed blue
  lines on the sheet (within 6 pixels; the pointer turns to a resize
  arrow and the line under it is drawn bolder; a drag inwards makes the
  margin larger, 0 to 200 mm; #580, #582).
- A drag on the sheet moves the artwork on its page (the move cursor and
  a tip say so), clear of the margins a printer leaves blank; Artwork
  position on the left shows and takes the move in millimetres (x right,
  y up) with Reset. Print prints it so: the imposition moves every page
  of the sheet by it, its clip and marks with it (#536,
  `export::tests::the_artwork_moved_in_print_preview_prints_moved`).
- Transform (left panel, off at first) draws eight handles around the
  artwork's cell: a side handle stretches it on that axis, a corner
  handle scales it keeping its proportions (both axes by the factor of
  the axis the pointer moved most; #1543,
  `print_preview::tests::a_corner_handle_keeps_the_page_s_proportions`),
  the opposite side or corner staying put and the resize cursor showing;
  a drag inside moves it; the stretch shows as x and y percentages
  there, typed or reset to 100 % (#595). The handles come before the
  margin lines, which come before moving.
- Rotation (left panel, 0 at first, under Transform) turns every page
  on the sheet about its middle by any angle from -360 to 360 degrees
  counter-clockwise; the 90, 180 and 270 buttons add that turn. The
  page's clip and marks follow it, the marks standing round the box that
  holds the turned page, and Print prints it so
  (`imposition::tests::pages_turn_about_their_middle`).
- Stretch to fill (a fixed sheet): the pages stretch on each axis on
  their own to fill the room inside the paper margins (#591,
  `imposition::tests::pages_stretch_to_fill_and_follow_the_preview_transform`).
  With the page information on, "Drag moves the page information" makes
  a drag move that instead (#388).

## Imposition

- With facing pages each page prints with what its facing page holds
  across the spine and in the bleed beside it (not for the selection
  alone, nor with Fit to page; see `facing-pages.md`, #1972).
- Pages keep their aspect ratio; each cell is as large as the largest
  page on its sheet and a smaller page sits in its middle.
- Gap between pages (several pages per sheet and repeat on the sheet,
  0 to 50 mm, 5 mm at first): two fields, the gap across (between pages
  side by side) and the gap down (between rows), each on its own
  (#1795, `imposition::Options::gutter` and `gutter_y`,
  `imposition::tests::the_column_and_row_gaps_are_set_apart`). Options >
  Global > Printing starts every print with both; preferences saved
  before the gap down existed take the gap across for it
  (`prefs::tests::the_row_gap_is_remembered_and_old_preferences_take_the_column_gap`).
  A booklet's spread keeps its own Gap (below).
- Page order (several pages per sheet, #1658, `imposition::PageOrder`,
  `imposition::tests::n_up_pages_can_run_down_the_columns`):
  - Across, then down (default): left to right along each row, then the
    next row; the next sheet goes on from the last page of this one.
  - Down, then across: top to bottom down each column, then the next
    column to the right; the next sheet goes on from the last page of
    this one. 2 x 3: 1 2 3 down the first column, 4 5 6 down the
    second, 7 on the next sheet.
  - Down, through all sheets: top to bottom down each column, the
    column going on in the same column of the next sheet, and only
    after the last sheet does the next column start. Once the sheets are
    stacked and cut into columns, each column is one series. 2 x 3 on
    two sheets: 1 2 3 and 7 8 9 on the first sheet, 4 5 6 and 10 11 12
    on the second. Cells past the last page stay empty.
  - Cut and stack: each cell runs down the stack of sheets. With T
    pages and N cells a sheet there are S = ceil(T / N) sheets, and cell
    p (0 based, left to right, top to bottom) of sheet s holds page
    p * S + s, so each pile cut from the stacked sheets is one series and
    the piles go on top of each other in order. 100 pages 4 up: 1, 26,
    51 and 76 on the first sheet, 25, 50, 75 and 100 on the last; 10
    pages 4 up: 1 4 7 10, 2 5 8 and 3 6 9 over three sheets, the last
    cell of the last two empty.
- Layout presets (#1796): the Preset row at the top of the layout fields
  (Print dialog's Layout tab and Print Preview) lists the layouts saved
  under a name; choosing one sets the imposition, columns and rows, page
  order, sheet (by its name, or the Custom size) and orientation,
  Stretch to fill, Keep page size, Back side, both gaps, the paper
  margins, the booklet's binding, signature sheets, creep and gap, Bleed
  with its limit and every printers' mark. "+" asks for a name and OK
  (or Enter) keeps the layout under it, replacing a preset of that name;
  "-" deletes the chosen preset after a Yes. A preset whose settings are
  changed afterwards is shown unchosen. Presets are kept in the
  preferences (`prefs::PrintPrefs::layout_presets`). Save to file...
  writes the layout as a `.tdlayout` file (JSON: `format`
  `"tracedraw-print-layout"`, `version` 1 and the `layout`, the fields
  of `prefs::LayoutPreset`); Load from file... reads one (or a `.json`
  file holding one) into the open Print Preview or Print dialog and keeps
  it as a preset of its name. Another file is refused with a message;
  values out of range are brought into range
  (`prefs::tests::layout_presets_round_trip_through_a_file`,
  `ui::dialogs::layout_preset_tests`). File access goes through the
  app's file dialogs, so it works on the desktop, in the browser and on
  Android.
- A booklet's page count is rounded up to a multiple of four with blank
  pages at the back. The Layout fields (Print dialog and Print Preview)
  choose its binding by two pictures (#788, #947,
  `imposition::Booklet`):
  - Saddle stitch (default): every sheet folds inside the one before.
    The sheet sides pair the pages: for eight pages 8 and 1, 2 and 7, 6
    and 3, 4 and 5 (left and right).
  - Perfect bound: the sheets go in signatures of Sheets per signature
    (default 4, 1 to 32), each folded on its own as a small saddle
    stitch; the last signature takes the sheets left. One sheet per
    signature: 4 1, 2 3, 8 5, 6 7 (`imposition::booklet_sides`).
  - Creep (saddle stitch only, default 0, 0 to 20 mm): the pages of the
    sheet at depth d of n (0 the outer sheet) move toward the spine by
    creep x d / (n - 1), the left page right and the right page left;
    the outer sheet stays, the innermost moves by the creep. The page
    and its trim box move together, so crop marks follow.
  - Gap (default 0, 0 to 100 mm): the space between the two pages of a
    spread, centred on the fold; a fitted sheet grows by it. No bleed is
    kept between the two pages.
  - Under the sketch: the pages, the blank pages added and the sheets of
    paper (each printed on both sides), and for perfect binding the
    signatures (`imposition::booklet_info`). The page range (Pages) picks
    the pages that go into the booklet, and the sketch, its sheet count
    and the summary count those pages only (the range, the list, odd or
    even pages, the selection: `export::printed_pages`, the page set the
    print imposes, through `ui::dialogs::printed_page_sizes`), not the
    whole drawing: pages 1 to 20 of a hundred report 20 pages, 0 blanks
    and 5 sheets (#788,
    `ui::dialogs::booklet_fields_tests::the_summary_counts_the_pages_of_the_range`).
- Back side (n-up and step and repeat, #387): the columns run right to
  left, so a page's place on the sheet mirrors its place on the front
  about the sheet's middle and it prints behind its front on a
  double-sided sheet; the pages are not mirrored (unlike Mirror)
  (`imposition::tests::the_back_side_runs_the_columns_right_to_left`).
- Keep page size (a fixed sheet, #388): the pages are never scaled, not
  to make room for the marks (which take the room there is) nor to fit
  the grid: Several Pages per Sheet and Repeat Copies keep the columns
  and rows as set, and pages that do not fit run off the sheet; the
  sketch shows the sheet's part and a warning says what runs off is not
  printed (#496, `imposition::overflows`,
  `imposition::tests::kept_size_keeps_the_grid_and_the_page_size`).
  Without it the grid shrinks to fit inside the marks. Columns and rows go
  up to 99. The page information can be moved:
  with it on, a drag on the sheet in Print Preview moves it (an offset in
  mm, "Page information back in place" resets it)
  (`imposition::tests::kept_size_does_not_shrink_pages_for_marks`).
- Every page is clipped to its trim box plus the bleed, so nothing spills
  onto its neighbours or the margin. Hidden and non-printing layers are
  left out; master layers print with every page they show on; a page
  background prints under its page.

## Marks

With any mark on, a 12 mm margin (plus the bleed) surrounds the pages.

- Crop marks: 5 mm lines in registration colour, 0.1 mm wide, starting
  1.5 mm beyond the bleed, at every cut line of the grid, outside the
  pages only. A booklet also gets a dashed fold mark at the spine, half way
  between its two pages.
- Registration marks: a target (circle and cross) centred on each side
  of the pages.
- Color bars: patches of 4 mm of cyan, magenta, yellow, black, red,
  green, blue (two-ink overprints) and 50 % tints of the four inks, left
  of the top target.
- Densitometer scale: black from 0 to 100 % in steps of ten, right of the
  top target.
- Page numbers: each page's number, 6 pt, under the page.
- Page information: the drawing's name (or the text given), the pages on the sheet, "sheet n
  of n" and the date and time, in 6 pt under the pages.
