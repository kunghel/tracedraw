# Android app

The same editor built as an Android app for 64-bit ARM tablets and
phones (#893): `libtracedraw.so`, the `tracedraw` crate compiled as a
shared library for `aarch64-linux-android` (and `x86_64-linux-android`
for Chromebooks with Intel or AMD processors), loaded by the app's activity
(`dev.tracedraw.app.TraceDrawActivity`, a `NativeActivity` with a page
of Java in `packaging/android/java`) and packaged as an APK and as an
App Bundle. eframe drives egui through winit's Android backend
(`android-activity`, native activity) and draws with wgpu through
OpenGL ES 3, which the manifest requires; touch and stylus events
reach egui as pointer and touch events, so the canvas, toolbox, property
bar and menus work with a finger or a pen. Phase 2 (files and the
clipboard through the system, a bundle for Google Play) builds, and CI
starts it on Android 11 and Android 14 emulators on every push, where
it stays up and draws the editor (see "The emulator check" below). It
is not one of the release downloads; `docs/android-play.md` lists what
the owner does to publish it and what to test on a tablet first.

## What works and what does not yet

| Feature | Desktop | Android, phase 2 |
|---|---|---|
| The editor: drawing tools, shapes, text, effects, menus, dockers, undo | yes | yes, the same code |
| Workspace | the one chosen | a fresh install starts in the Touch workspace (`workspaces.md`: bars and buttons 1.4 times larger, no rulers, panels or status bar, two fingers pan, a pinch zooms); Window > Workspace picks another and it is kept. A phone (smallest width under 600 dp) gets the phone layout in any workspace (`workspaces.md`, Touch): no enlargement, menu titles that do not fit under », panels as full sheets, sliding bars, toolbox and palette (#1301, #1497, #1691); a finger dragged along a bar, the toolbox or the palette that is longer than the screen slides it, a tap on a button still works, and a docker's contents scroll under a finger (#1997, `toolbars.md`) |
| Camera cutout and rounded screen corners (#1917) | the whole window | the interface is laid out inside a safe area: with Options > Display > Screen margins > "Follow the system's cutout and corners" (on by default) it keeps clear of what the system reports at each layout through the activity's `getScreenInsets` (the visible system bars and the cutout, `WindowInsets.getInsets(systemBars \| displayCutout)`, before Android 11 the system window insets and `DisplayCutout`; from Android 12 the radius of each rounded corner, `getRoundedCorner`, which keeps both sides it joins `r (1 - 1/sqrt 2)` clear so nothing crosses the arc). Many phones report no corners, so Top, Bottom, Left and Right margins of the user's own, in dp (density-independent, the same at any interface size), are added on top, each from 0 to 32 dp (more than a corner or a cutout the system does not report needs; up to 0.43 a margin went to 200 dp: 90 dp at the left of a 360 dp phone left the Options dialog cut off, and two such margins took the whole screen, #2174), and the margins of two facing sides together take at most a fifth of the window's width or height, shrunk in proportion on a small window (a split screen, a phone on its side), so the interface always keeps four fifths of each side; a settings file that holds more is read the same way (`screen_margins::tests::margins_cannot_take_the_screen_away`); "Same on all sides" links them, Reset follows the system again with none. The room outside is filled with the theme's frame colour, and Corner radius (0 to 64 dp) rounds the interface's inner corners. Every change shows at once; the values are kept in the settings and stay the same when the screen turns. The margins are egui's safe area insets, so panels, dockers, dialogs and menus keep to `Context::content_rect` (`ui/screen_margins.rs`) |
| Right click and keys, by finger | mouse and keyboard | Delete and Panels on the standard toolbar (with Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, Redo); Shift, Ctrl, Alt and Delete keys floating over the drawing's bottom left corner (#1996; up to 0.42 Shift, Ctrl and Alt sat on the Standard toolbar, and a toolbar kept with them draws nothing in their place), Shift, Ctrl and Alt each held down by a tap until the next tap on it and drawn pressed meanwhile, or held down as a key is by a finger kept on it while another finger draws (the key's finger is taken out of the input, so the two are not a pan or a pinch, and the drawing finger moves the pointer; the key is let go with its finger, `touch_modifiers::fingers_on_keys`, #2362, `ui::tests::ctrl_from_the_keys_on_the_drawing_keeps_the_pen_to_the_constrain_angle`), so a finger adds objects or nodes to the selection (Shift), picks inside a group or keeps a drag to one direction (Ctrl) and picks the object behind (Alt): the held keys join every frame's input as the keyboard's would (`touch_modifiers.rs`, #1499); they show on Android and wherever a finger has touched the window unless Options > Display > Show Shift, Ctrl, Alt and Delete on the drawing (on at first) is off, and Alt held this way does not put the bars in their customize mode (`ui::tests::a_finger_holds_shift_from_the_keys_on_the_drawing_to_add_to_the_selection`); a tap of two fingers on the drawing undoes and of three redoes: every finger lifted within 0.35 s of the first one down, none moved more than 12 points, all on the drawing (not on a window, a menu or the keys), so a pinch or a pan never undoes (`touch_taps.rs`, `touch_taps::tests`); a finger held 0.8 s on the drawing opens the object's or the page's menu; on a palette swatch a hold of 0.5 s sets the outline, 1 s shows the shades (#1611, #1707) |
| Open, Import, palettes, scripts, ICC profiles, every "pick a file" | system file dialog | the system's document picker (Storage Access Framework, `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT`, any type): the picked document opens by the extension of its display name; the closure runs on a later frame, as in the browser |
| Save on an opened drawing | writes the file | writes the document back through its content URI (the picker grants read and write, kept across restarts) |
| Save As, Export, Export as PDF, Save Bitmap As, exports of dockers that use `save_file` | the Save Drawing dialog with folders, or the system save dialog | the Save Drawing dialog shows name, type and version only, then the system's picker (`ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT`) asks where, with that name and the type's MIME; the file is written when it answers. Export as PDF has no Browse button: OK opens the picker |
| Tone curve and duotone presets, the mask file, macro scripts and exports, palette files | system save dialog | the system's save picker asks where, with the suggested name (`Dialog::save_file`, #1402); a macro export with more than one file (a form's `.frm` and `.frx`) asks for each in turn. `Dialog::save_path`, which would save into the app's documents folder without asking, is used only by Export as PDF's Browse, which Android does not show (`files::tests::saves_ask_where_on_android`) |
| Recent files, Welcome screen thumbnails | paths | the same list: a picked document is named `/content/<its URI, escaped>/<its display name>` (`files::document_path`), so the name shows and the URI reopens it; the system keeps the permission (`takePersistableUriPermission`) |
| Pick a folder | system folder dialog | never shown (#1399, see "Folder buttons" in `web.md`, the same table): the Export docker writes its assets into one zip file the save picker places; Print Merge's pictures folder opens the system's folder picker (`ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE`, `Dialog::pick_folder_files`, #1926): the activity lists the documents of the folder chosen, leaving its subfolders out, and they come back as picked documents, kept to the picture types and gathered as the pictures folder, the right to read the folder kept; Font Manager > Add Folder, Picture Mosaic's Browse and Options > Spelling's More dictionaries open the picker for several files at once; the backup folders in Options > Save are greyed with the reason |
| File > Package, Save As > Package | a folder with the drawing, its pictures, fonts and report | File > Package asks for the name and the PDF, then the system's save picker for `<name>.zip`, and writes the package as one zip file there (#1401, `behavior/package.md`); Save As's Package box is greyed with the reason |
| Print | the system's printers, or the PDF viewer | the system's print service (#1398): the Print dialog's destination reads "System printer (through the Android print service)", the print PDF is made as on the desktop and handed to `PrintManager`, whose dialog picks the printer, the copies and the paper; PDF and PostScript files go through the save picker |
| Send To | a PDF in the Desktop or Documents folder, or for a mail | Documents: the save picker asks where the PDF goes; Mail Recipient: the share sheet, limited to the apps that send mail, gets the PDF as an attachment; Desktop is greyed with the reason (Android has no desktop folder) |
| Edit Bitmap | the bitmap editor of the options, or the system's program for PNG files | "open with" (`ACTION_EDIT`): Android asks which app edits the picture and lets it write the picture back; the editor reads it again when it changes, as on the desktop. Options > File Locations says so instead of asking for a program. No app that edits pictures: the status bar says so |
| Opening a page or a file (Help, links, Open Folder) | the system's browser and programs | web pages in the browser and files in the app picked for their type (`ACTION_VIEW`); Open Folder is greyed with the reason (Android shows no app's private folder to other apps) |
| Clipboard | text, images and files through the system clipboard | text, pictures and files through the system's clipboard service: Copy puts the selection's SVG text there (other apps paste it as text, the editor as objects), Paste reads text copied elsewhere (artistic text, or objects when it is SVG), a picture copied elsewhere as a bitmap and documents copied elsewhere as imports (#1403); copies inside the editor work as before |
| Text size and contrast (#1412) | the desktop's text size and high contrast | the system's font scale (Settings > Display > Font size, which reaches the running app: `fontScale` is among the configuration changes the activity handles) and Android 14's contrast setting or high contrast text, read through the activity's `getAccessibility` every 3 s (`behavior/options.md`) |
| Options that do nothing on Android (#1415) | shown | hidden: Show the splash screen (the app starts without one), Use hardware acceleration and the graphics card (the app always draws with OpenGL ES, `gpu::ANDROID_BACKENDS`) and the AI agents section of Global > General (no agent on the phone to serve; a setting carried over from a desktop opens no link, `App::sync_mcp_link`); Edit Bitmap's program says Android asks which app edits the picture (#1398) |
| Settings | `settings.json` in the configuration folder | `settings.json` in the app's private folder (`TRACEDRAW_CONFIG_DIR` set by `android_main`) |
| Fonts | installed system fonts | the system's fonts (`/system/fonts`, `/product/fonts` and `/vendor/fonts`: Roboto, Noto and the rest; the font database looks in no folder on Android by itself, so `tracedraw_text` names these). Font Manager > Add Font copies the picked font into `fonts` in the app's private folder and installs it from there, at once and at every start (#1400); Add Folder picks several font files at once and adds each the same way (#1399) |
| Keyboard | the physical keyboard | a physical or Bluetooth keyboard works. The on-screen keyboard shows while a text, a table cell or a field takes typed text and types into an invisible view of the activity (`TextInputView`): a `NativeActivity` offers input methods no text field, so before #1309 only the key presses of Latin letters arrived and Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Tamil and other composed scripts never did. What the input method composes, commits and deletes reaches the editor as an input method's events (`soft_keyboard.rs`), its Backspace, Enter and arrow presses as keys. A tap with the Text tool starts a text there and brings the keyboard up; a tap into the text or field once more brings it back after the system's key hid it; it hides only once three frames in a row take no text, so a lone frame without the caret does not hide it and end what the input method composes; when the system ignores the request (the view's focus reaches the input method a moment later), it is made again up to five times, 100 ms apart. The emulator check types through a test keyboard and as key presses (see "The emulator check"); not checked on a device |
| Updates | a check of GitHub's releases, asked about at the first start | none: Google Play updates the app (its policy refuses apps that download code of their own), so there is no first-start question and no daily check; Help > Updates opens the app's Play page (`updates::store_install`) |
| AI Drawing, AI Generate, GitHub, dictionary downloads | HTTPS requests, certificates checked by the system's verifier | the same requests, certificates checked against the system's own store, the files Android's TLS reads (`/apex/com.android.conscrypt/cacerts` on Android 14 and later, else `/system/etc/security/cacerts`), read once at the first request, with the Mozilla roots bundled in the app when neither can be read (`net::tls_config`). The system's verifier the desktop uses needs a Java part the app does not carry, so every request failed its certificate check before (#1396). The emulator check sends one request at the start and wants it answered (see "The emulator check") |
| Temporary files (auto-backups, crash recovery) | the system's temporary folder | `tmp` in the app's private folder (`TMPDIR` set by `android_main`: the system's default, `/data/local/tmp`, is closed to apps) |
| Help | the user Help in the browser | the same pages open in the browser |
| Errors | a message box and the log file | the system log only: `adb logcat -s tracedraw` |
| Configuration changes (rotation, window size, keyboard, dark mode, language, font size) | the window follows them | the same: the activity declares them (`android:configChanges`), so the system does not relaunch it. A relaunch the manifest cannot prevent (a new screen density, a change of the system's resource overlays: wallpaper colours, icon shapes, display cutout) ends the process once the drawings are backed up, and the system starts the app again in a new process, which offers them (see "Relaunches" below) |

## Mouse

A Bluetooth or USB mouse, or a touchpad, works as a mouse (#2152,
#2161): the left, right and middle buttons (the right one opens the
menus a right click opens on the desktop), the wheel (it zooms and
scrolls as on the desktop, with Ctrl and Shift from a keyboard too) and
the pointer hovering over the buttons. winit's Android backend turned
every pointer of a motion event into a touch and dropped the actions it
had no touch for, so every button clicked like a finger, the wheel did
nothing and nothing was hovered. The patched copy of winit
(`vendor/winit/src/android_mouse.rs`, `vendor/README.md`) now takes the
motion events whose source is a mouse (`SOURCE_MOUSE`) or whose pointer's
tool is one (`TOOL_TYPE_MOUSE`) and tells the window what a desktop's
mouse would:

- every event puts the pointer at its place (`CursorMoved`), hover
  events included, and a hover that ends with no press after it means
  the pointer left the window;
- the buttons come from the event's button state (`getButtonState`:
  primary, secondary, tertiary, back, forward), compared with the one
  told last, so each button goes down and up once whichever of
  `ACTION_DOWN`, `ACTION_BUTTON_PRESS`, `ACTION_MOVE`,
  `ACTION_BUTTON_RELEASE` and `ACTION_UP` the system sends; a press that
  names no button is the left one;
- `ACTION_SCROLL` turns the wheel by lines: `AXIS_VSCROLL` up and down,
  `AXIS_HSCROLL` sideways.

A finger and a pen are not touched by this, and palm rejection does not
look at the mouse. Checks: `winit_android_mouse::tests` (fake motion
events: a left and a right click as Android 6 and later and as older
versions send them, a second button during a drag, the wheel, the hover
and its end); the patched copy is type-checked for
`aarch64-linux-android`. Not checked on a device or on the emulator (its
check sends no mouse events).

## Palm rejection

A hand resting on a tablet while a pen draws touches the screen too, and
before #1832 it drew, picked and panned like a finger. Android tells
each pointer's tool (`MotionEvent.getToolType`: finger, stylus, eraser,
mouse, or a palm the system recognised), and reports a pen hovering
over the screen; winit drops both. The patched copy of winit
(`vendor/winit/src/pointer_filter.rs`, `vendor/README.md`) asks the
app's filter (`palm.rs`, set from `android_main`) about every pointer
of each motion event, with its tool and action, and about each hover,
before it hands the touch on; it delivers the touch only when the
filter says so, and first ends with `Cancelled` the touches the filter
names. With Options > Tools > Freehand/Bezier, "Ignore the hand while
drawing with a pen" on (the default; the box shows on Android only):

- a pen (stylus or its eraser end) always gets through;
- a finger that comes down while a pen touches the screen or hovers
  over it is ignored until it lifts;
- a pen that comes down while fingers of the same screen are down
  (the hand landed first) ends those touches, which are then ignored
  until they lift;
- with no pen near, fingers work as before, two of them pan and a pinch
  zooms;
- a touch the system calls a palm never gets through.

Off, every touch gets through. The activity's Java code sees none of
these events: a `NativeActivity` hands its input queue to the native
code, so the tool type comes from the NDK's motion events
(`AMotionEvent_getToolType`, through `android-activity`), and
`TraceDrawActivity.java` has no touch handler of its own to pass it on
(its `TextInputView` only takes the keyboard's input). Checks:
`palm::tests` (fake motion events: the hand while the pen is down, while
it hovers, a hand that landed first, fingers alone, the option off) and
`winit_pointer_filter::tests`; not checked on a device (the emulator
check has no pen).

Pen pressure is #850 (another change): `android-activity` exposes
`MotionEvent` pressure per pointer, so when winit passes it on the
Freehand tool's pressure code can read it the same way as on the
desktop.

## Files through the system picker

Android apps built for Android 11 and later cannot browse the shared
storage themselves; they ask the system's picker, which hands back a
content URI with a grant to read it (and write it, for most providers).
TraceDraw keeps the editor's path-based code and names each document by
a synthetic path:

```text
/content/content:%2F%2Fcom.android.externalstorage.documents%2Fdocument%2Fprimary%253ADrawings%252Flogo.cdr/logo.cdr
```

`files::document_path(uri, name)` makes it (every `%` of the URI becomes
`%25`, every `/` becomes `%2F`, the display name is the last part),
`files::document_uri(path)` gives the URI back, `files::read` and
`files::write` call the activity's `readDocument` and `writeDocument`
for such a path (`write_with` gathers the bytes first), `canonical`
leaves it alone and `exists` says yes (the system holds the file and
asked about replacing it). A picked document without an extension gets
one from its MIME type (`name_with_extension`), and the save picker is
told the MIME type of the name's extension (`mime_for_extension`: PDF,
the image types, SVG, text; a plain byte stream for `.tdraw` and `.cdr`,
which keeps the name as typed).

The flow, from the editor's thread: `Dialog::pick_file` (or `pick_files`,
`pick_into`, `save_file`) takes a request code, remembers what to do
with the answer (`files::android_pickers`) and calls the activity's
`openDocument` or `createDocument` over JNI (`android::documents`); the
activity starts the picker on its UI thread; `onActivityResult` takes
the persistable permission, reads each document's display name and MIME
type and calls the native method `nativeDocumentResult` (registered from
`android_main` with `RegisterNatives` on the activity's class, as the
library is loaded by the system, not by `System.loadLibrary` alone);
the Rust side queues the answer and asks egui for a frame;
`files::run_finished`, called once per frame, runs the waiting closure
with the documents' paths. A cancelled picker runs nothing. Several
documents (Import of many) come as newline-separated lists.

## Printing, sharing and "open with"

The print service, the share sheet and the other apps need the file
itself, and the editor's files (the print PDF, a picture to edit) live in
the app's private folders, which no other app can open. The activity's
file provider, `SharedFiles` (`packaging/android/java`, authority
`dev.tracedraw.app.files`, not exported, `grantUriPermissions`), serves
the files of the app's files and cache folders under
`content://dev.tracedraw.app.files/files/<path>` (or `cache/<path>`),
with the display name and size share targets ask for; a path that leads
out of those folders (`..`, links) is refused. The bridge
(`android::outside`) calls the activity's `printFile` (a
`PrintDocumentAdapter` that copies the ready PDF to the service),
`shareFile` (`ACTION_SEND` with the file as `EXTRA_STREAM` and a read
grant, in the system's chooser; a `mailto:` selector for Mail Recipient
keeps the mail apps only), `editFile` (`ACTION_EDIT` with read and write
grants) and `viewTarget` (`ACTION_VIEW` for a web address, a picked
document's content URI or one of the app's files). Each runs on the UI
thread, answers whether the system took it, and a missing app comes back
as false, which the status bar reports. `export::open_with_system` goes
through `viewTarget` on Android, so Help, links and the other "open"
commands work there; a folder cannot be shown (`status.no_folders_on_android`).

## The system clipboard

`android::clipboard::text`, `documents` and `set_text` call the
activity's `getClipboardText`, `getClipboardDocuments` and
`setClipboardText`, which run on the UI thread
(`ClipboardManager` wants it) and wait up to two seconds. Android 10 and
later hand the clipboard's content only to the app in front, which the
editor is when it pastes. `getClipboardText` skips the clip's documents
(their URI is no text); `getClipboardDocuments` lists them as "URI, type,
name" lines, and `clipboard.rs` makes one picture alone the clipboard's
picture and the rest files named like the document picker's (#1403).

## Building the APK and the bundle

```sh
rustup target add aarch64-linux-android x86_64-linux-android
export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=/path/to/android-ndk-r28   # r26 or later
export ANDROID_ABIS="arm64-v8a x86_64"   # arm64-v8a alone by default
# aapt2, zipalign, apksigner and d8 from an Android SDK (ANDROID_HOME)
# with platforms/android-36 (or ANDROID_PLATFORM_JAR); a JDK (javac,
# keytool, jarsigner); bundletool (BUNDLETOOL_JAR, on PATH, or
# downloaded once into dist-android/tools).
scripts/android/build.sh
adb install -r dist-android/tracedraw-<version>-android-arm64-v8a-debug.apk
```

The script builds the library for each ABI in `ANDROID_ABIS`
(`cargo rustc -p tracedraw --lib --release --target
aarch64-linux-android --crate-type cdylib`, and `x86_64-linux-android`
for `x86_64`, with the NDK's clang as the C compiler and linker for the
Rust target and the dependencies' C code), strips it, compiles the activity (`javac -source 8 -target 8`
against the platform's `android.jar`, then `d8 --min-api 24` into one
`classes.dex`), compiles the launcher icons (`packaging/android/res`,
from the application icon), links them with the manifest
(`packaging/android/AndroidManifest.xml`: package `dev.tracedraw.app`,
`TraceDrawActivity` with `android.app.lib_name` = `tracedraw`, minimum
Android 7.0 / API 24, target Android 16 / API 36, full-screen theme,
every configuration change handled by the app, `INTERNET` the only
permission) into an APK with the version code from `Cargo.toml`
(0.19.10 is 19010), and makes one APK per ABI
(`tracedraw-<version>-android-<abi>-debug.apk`): it adds the code and
that ABI's library (`lib/arm64-v8a/libtracedraw.so`), aligns it and
signs it with a debug
key (`~/.android/debug.keystore`, made when missing, as the Android
tools do). A debug-signed APK installs on a device that allows apps from
unknown sources and is not for a store.

For the bundle the same parts are linked again in protocol buffer form
(`aapt2 link --proto-format`) and laid out as a base module
(`manifest/AndroidManifest.xml`, `resources.pb`, `res/`,
`dex/classes.dex`, `lib/<abi>/` for every ABI built; Play hands each
device only its own), which `bundletool build-bundle`
turns into the `.aab`; `jarsigner` signs it with the upload key when
`ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` (or `ANDROID_KEYSTORE`), `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`,
`ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` and `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` are set
(`tracedraw-<version>-android-release.aab`, for Play App Signing with
our upload key) and with the debug key otherwise
(`tracedraw-<version>-android-debug.aab`, for `bundletool build-apks
--local-testing` only); `bundletool validate` checks the result.
bundletool 1.18.1 is pinned with its SHA-256 for the download.

CI (`build.yml`, job `android`) builds both on every push with the NDK
the GitHub runner has, for `arm64-v8a` and `x86_64`, installs platform
36 when the runner lacks it,
passes the four signing secrets to the script (absent: the debug key)
and keeps the `android-apk` and `android-aab` artifacts; the APKs are
attached to the nightly and to every version's release with the
installers (debug-signed: a build from another run installs only after
the one on the tablet is removed), uploading to Play is the owner's step
(`docs/android-play.md`).

Checks: `android_package::tests::the_manifest_and_the_build_agree` (the
manifest names the activity, the library, the package and the API
levels; the build makes the library, the code, the APK and the bundle
with the signing variables; the crate carries the Android dependencies
at exact versions; CI passes the secrets and keeps both artifacts) and
`the_activity_and_the_bridge_agree` (every Java method the Rust bridge
calls exists with the signature the bridge names; the native method the
activity declares is the one the bridge registers; every picker call
ends in a result), `ci_starts_the_apk_on_an_emulator` (the emulator job,
its pinned action and what the check looks for) and
`play_updates_the_android_app`; `gpu::tests::android_draws_with_one_graphics_api`
(OpenGL ES only). `files::tests` cover the document paths and the MIME
types. Built here on Linux x86_64 with NDK r28.2, build-tools 36.1.0 and
the API 36 `android.jar`: the APK and both bundle variants come out,
`aapt dump badging` gives the package, version code, minimum API 24,
target 36, `native-code: arm64-v8a` and the launchable activity,
`apksigner verify` passes with the v2 and v3 schemes, `bundletool
validate` accepts the bundle and `bundletool build-apks` makes a
universal APK from it. The picker, the saves and the clipboard on a
tablet are the next checks, listed in `docs/android-play.md`.

## The emulator check

CI's `android-emulator` job starts the app on Android emulators with
KVM on every push, Android 11 (API 30) and Android 14 (API 34), through
`scripts/android/emulator_check.sh`: it installs the x86_64 APK, starts
the launcher activity and fails unless, 45 s later, the app's process is
still the one that started (or, after a relaunch by the system that the
app logged, the one the system started again), then switches the first
display cutout overlay the emulator offers on and off again (`cmd
overlay`, each switch relaunches the activity) and wants the app back in
a new process that draws its first frame each time, and fails unless the
app has the focus, the system log has
no Java `FATAL EXCEPTION`, native crash (`Fatal signal`, a tombstone),
Rust panic (`panicked at`, `RustPanic`, the app's own `panic:` line) or
ANR, the app logged its first frame and did not find zero system fonts,
and the screenshot shows a drawn window (`scripts/android/screen_check.py`:
no colour on more than 97 % of the screen, at least 16 colours). The
screenshot, the whole system log, the app's lines and the crash log are
kept as the `android-emulator-api30` and `android-emulator-api34`
artifacts; the screenshot shows the editor with its menus, toolbars,
toolbox, the Welcome Screen and the docker tabs. When the check fails on
GitHub Actions, it also writes the crash lines, the app's last log
lines, the activity's events, the focus and, for a process still there,
its main thread's Java stack as annotations on the job, which can be
read without downloading the artifacts.

The app is started with `--es tracedraw.https_check
https://api.github.com/zen` (`TRACEDRAW_HTTPS_URL` changes the address;
empty sends none): it sends one GET the way the online features send
theirs and logs `HTTPS check: <url> answered <status>` or the error.
The check notes the answer and the certificate store read (`HTTPS: <n>
trusted certificates from <folder>`) and fails when the request was
refused for its certificate; an emulator without a network only gets a
notice (#1396).

With the test keyboard (`scripts/android/test-ime`, an input method
built by `scripts/android/build_test_ime.sh`, installed and made the
system's keyboard by the check, never shipped), the check also types
(#1489, #1496): the app is started with `--es tracedraw.check typing`,
opens a drawing with the Text tool on (`soft_keyboard::check`) and logs
what the text being edited reads after each change; the check taps the
middle of the screen and wants a text started and the keyboard shown for
the app, then has the keyboard compose "ni" and commit 你好 and "abc"
through the system's input method service, and types "xyz" as key
presses (`adb shell input text`), each of which must reach the text. The
outcome, with the input method service's state and the keyboard's log
when a step fails, is a notice on the job.

The x86_64 library runs natively there. The ARM64 library cannot be
checked this way: the emulator's ARM translation (Android 11 and 14
images) stops it in the first JNI calls of the activity glue, before
any TraceDraw code runs (the `jni` crate's exception check sees an
exception flagged and none to fetch, and the glue aborts), while the
same code compiled for x86_64 passes them. The ARM64 build is the same
source; a device check (`docs/android-play.md`) covers it.

The check found and the code now handles: the window drawn with both
Vulkan and OpenGL ES asked for (a Vulkan surface holds the Android
window, OpenGL ES could not draw into it and wgpu stopped the app;
the app asks for OpenGL ES only, `gpu::ANDROID_BACKENDS`), no system
fonts (the font database looks in no folder on Android), the temporary
folder (`/data/local/tmp` is closed to apps) and the update question at
the first start (Google Play updates the app).

## Relaunches

The system relaunches an activity (destroys it and makes a new one) on
any configuration change it does not declare in `android:configChanges`,
and always on a change of the system's resource overlays (configuration
change `0x80000000`, assets paths: wallpaper colours, icon shapes, a
display cutout switched on; no manifest entry covers it). Android 14
emulators do that once right after booting, and about one start in four
in CI landed on it. A `NativeActivity` cannot be relaunched in place:
its `onDestroy` waits for `android_main` to return, which it never does
(winit ignores the destroy, and runs one event loop per process, so the
editor could not start again in the same process anyway). The app froze
for good on the system's starting window, never drawing, with the
activity's thread blocked.

Now:

- The manifest declares every configuration change the editor follows
  by itself (orientation, screen size and layout, keyboard, navigation,
  touch screen, UI mode, locale, layout direction, MCC and MNC, font
  scale and weight, colour mode, grammatical gender), so those never
  relaunch it. The screen density is left out: a new density starts the
  editor afresh at its scale.
- `TraceDrawActivity.onDestroy` starts a thread and then calls
  `NativeActivity.onDestroy`, which first takes the window from the
  editor: winit's Suspended, on which eframe's save backs the drawings
  up (`Shell::save`, #1395). The thread waits (`nativeAwaitWindowGone`,
  `android::ending`, at most 10 s) until the editor's thread holds no
  window any more, logs `the activity is relaunched: the process ends`
  and ends the process.
- `android:stateNotNeeded="true"` makes the system keep the activity
  when its process ends and start it again in a new process; the new
  start offers the backed-up drawings as after any end of the app it
  was not told about. A finished activity (not relaunched) ends the
  same way and stays closed.

## How it is wired

- `apps/tracedraw/src/lib.rs` holds the whole app; `main.rs` is the
  desktop and browser program (`tracedraw::run()`); `android.rs`
  (`#[cfg(target_os = "android")]`) is the Android entry:
  `android_main(app: AndroidApp)`, called by the glue of
  `android-activity` on the app's thread, sets up the system logger
  (tag `tracedraw`), a panic hook that logs, the settings and documents
  folders from the activity's paths, keeps the activity's JNI reference
  and registers the native method, the Touch workspace on a first start,
  the language, then `eframe::run_native` with `NativeOptions {
  android_app: Some(app), renderer: Wgpu }`, keeping the egui context
  for the wake-ups. eframe drops the window and surface on Suspended and
  makes them again on Resumed, as Android asks.
- `android.rs` also holds the JNI bridge: `with_activity` attaches the
  thread (`JavaVM::singleton`, which `android-activity` set up) and
  borrows the activity; `documents` (open, create, read, write, the
  answer queue, `register_natives`), `clipboard` (text, documents, set_text) and
  `keyboard` (the native methods of the keyboard's view, and a plugin
  that shows or hides the on-screen keyboard after each frame that asks
  for an input method or no longer does, `showTextInput`), `ending`
  (the wait of the activity's end, see "Relaunches") and `outside`
  (print, share, edit and view, through `SharedFiles`).
  Every JNI failure is logged and comes back as `None`, never a panic.
- `packaging/android/java/dev/tracedraw/app/TraceDrawActivity.java`: the
  activity, with the picker intents, `onActivityResult`, the content
  resolver reads and writes, the clipboard and the on-screen keyboard,
  all on the right threads. `TextInputView.java`: the one-pixel view the
  keyboard types into, whose input connection keeps no text and hands
  over what the input method composes, commits and deletes.
- `Cargo.toml`: a `[lib]` (doc tests off) beside the `[[bin]]`; `rfd`
  (file dialogs) on every target but Android; `arboard` (system
  clipboard) on the desktop targets only; `eframe` with
  `android-native-activity`, `android-activity 0.6.1`, `android_logger
  0.15.1` and `jni 0.22.4` (the version `android-activity` uses) on
  Android only. The desktop and browser builds resolve the same
  dependencies as before.
- `files.rs`: `ANDROID`, the document paths, the Android branches of
  `read`, `write`, `write_with`, `exists`, `canonical` and `Dialog`
  (`android_pickers`); `Dialog::save_file`'s closure is `'static` on
  every platform now, as the answer may come on a later frame.
  `clipboard.rs`: the system clipboard's text, pictures and documents on Android;
  `ui/save_as.rs`: Save and Save As hand the name and type to the
  picker; `ui/publish_pdf.rs`: OK opens the picker; `startup_log.rs`:
  error boxes go to the log on Android.

## Later phases

1. Opening a `.cdr` or `.tdraw` from a file manager (`ACTION_VIEW`).
2. Pen pressure and tilt (#850).
3. The Help inside the app.
4. A 32-bit ARM library for older devices; the store listing's
   screenshots from a device.
