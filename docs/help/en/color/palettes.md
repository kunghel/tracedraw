# Color palettes

The color palette along the bottom of the window is the quickest way to color
objects. Below it, the **document palette** collects the colors your drawing
uses. You can open more palettes, make your own and edit them.

## Using the palette {#using}

| Action | Result |
|---|---|
| Click a color | fills the selection (with nothing selected, sets the fill of new objects) |
| Right-click a color | colors the outline of the selection |
| Hold the right button on a color for a second (or right-click it, when right-click is set to open the menu), then **Delete Color** | takes that color out of a palette of yours or the document palette |
| Double-click the palette outside the colors | opens the palette editor on that palette |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+click a color | mixes a tenth of it into the selection's fill |
| Click and hold a color | shows lighter, darker, duller and brighter shades of it to choose from |
| Drag a color onto an object | fills the object, or colors its outline when dropped on the edge |
| Drag a picture from the drawing onto a palette | offers the picture's colors to that palette (see below) |
| Click the crossed-out well | removes the fill (right-click: the outline) |

The arrows at the ends scroll the palette, and the button at the right end
shows every color at once. Hover a color to see its name and values. The
palette menu button at the left end opens the palette menu. The mouse wheel
over the palette scrolls it; with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> held, the wheel makes the
swatches larger (wheel up) or smaller (wheel down), from 8 to 48 px, and the
size is remembered. The palette menu's **Swatch Size** offers five sizes, from
**Extra Small** to **Extra Large**, and **Rows** shows 1 to 8 rows of swatches,
or **Fit** for as many as show every color.

The palette can be moved to another edge of the window, or made to float:
drag it by its dotted grip. With two or three rows, the window showing every
color opens clear of all the rows.

### Several palettes

You can have several palettes open at once, each in a bar of its own: tick
one in [[menu.window > menu.window.color_palettes]], click its eye in the
Palette Manager, or pick it from **Open as Palette Bar** in a palette's menu.
The document palette can have a bar of its own too.

- Each bar can go to any edge of the window (along the left and right edges
  its swatches stand in columns) or float in a small window: drag it by its
  dotted grip or its title, or pick a place from **Position** in its menu.
- A bar can also sit beside another bar on the same side: drag it over the
  toolbox, the default palette, a column of panels or another palette bar,
  and let go on the half towards the inside to put it just inside that bar,
  or on the half towards the window's edge to put it just outside. A blue
  line shows where. Several palette bars can stand side by side this way,
  in the order you put them, for example a second row next to the default
  palette or a column next to the toolbox.
- Drag the right or bottom edge of a floating palette to resize it: the
  swatches flow into rows in a wide window and into columns in a tall one.
- Each bar has its own **Swatch Size** and **Rows**.
- **Close Palette** in its menu, or the close button of its window, closes
  it.
- The palettes you have open, where they are, their sizes and rows are
  remembered, and saved in workspace files.

### Colors from a picture

Drag a picture (a bitmap) from the drawing with the Pick tool and let go on
any open palette, docked or floating, the document palette too. The picture
stays where it was, and **Extract Colors from Picture** opens:

![Extract Colors from Picture](../../img/color-palettes-picture-colors.png)

Set the
**Number of colors** (2 to 64, 8 at first) with the slider or type it in the
box, and the swatches under it show the colors you will get. **OK** adds them
to the palette you dropped the picture on, skipping the colors it already
has; **Cancel** adds nothing. Built-in and locked palettes cannot be changed:
OK then makes a new palette of yours with the colors, in a bar of its own.
The colors are the same as those of **Add Colors from Bitmap** in a palette's
menu, which still works with a picture selected. On the document palette the
colors are one step of Undo; your own palettes are not part of the drawing,
so Cancel is the way to back out.

### Naming palettes

Any palette, built in or the document palette too, can have a name of your
own: choose **Rename...** in its menu or in the Palette Manager, or
double-click its name there. The name shows everywhere the palette is listed;
**Reset Name** gives back its own name. Built-in palettes' files are never
changed; a palette of yours saved as `.gpl` or `.tdpal` keeps the name in its
file.

Along each side it can lie at the window's edge or beside the drawing, between the drawing and the panels or the toolbox on that side. When a side has two columns of panels (drag a panel's tab just inside its column, over the drawing, to make a second one), the palette can also lie between the two columns. While you drag it, a blue band shows where it will go; right-click its grip to pick a place from a list.

## The document palette {#document-palette}

Every color you apply to an object joins the document palette, which is saved
with the drawing. Its eyedropper adds the color under the pointer, and its
menu has **Automatically update** (to stop adding colors by themselves),
**Add from selection**, **Add from document**, **Delete color** and **Reset
palette** (keeps only the colors the drawing still uses; it asks first, and
Undo brings the others back). To take out one color, right-click it and
choose **Delete Color**. You can also drag
colors or objects onto it. The color used last has a white frame: a color
taken with the eyedropper that the palette already has gets the frame, so you
see where it is, and applying a color of the palette moves the frame to it.
To show or hide it, see
[Customization options](../customize/customization.md#color-palette).

## The Palettes panel {#palettes-docker}

The [[docker.palettes]] panel lists the palettes you have in three sections,
**Built-in**, **My Palettes** and **Document Palette**. Open it with
[[menu.window > menu.window.color_palettes > menu.window.palette_manager]].

![The Palettes panel](../../img/color-palettes.png)

- Each palette shows its first colors, how many colors it has, its color
  model and where it is shown. Click the eye to open it in a bar of its own,
  or to close its bar.
- Click a palette to select it: the **Swatch Size** slider then sizes the
  swatches of its bar as you drag (the ticks are the five named sizes), and
  **Rows** sets its rows.
- The three-dot button, or a right-click, opens the palette's menu:
  open or close its bar, [[docker.edit]], **Rename...**, **Reset Name**,
  **Duplicate**, [[docker.palette_lock]] (palettes you opened or made, so the
  palette editor cannot change them; [[docker.palette_unlock]] allows editing
  again), **Delete Palette** (palettes you opened
  or made; the file stays), **Move Up** and **Move Down**. You can also drag a
  palette to another place in its section.
- Type in the filter box to list only the palettes whose name holds it.
- The buttons by the filter box: [[menu.window.palette_open]] opens a palette
  file (`.tdpal`, `.gpl`, `.ase` or `.aco`; opening the same file again does
  not add a second copy); [[menu.window.palette_from_document]] and
  [[menu.window.palette_from_selection]] fill the document palette with the
  colors of the drawing or of the selection.
- The document palette's colors show in its section; click one to fill the
  selection, right-click to color the outline. **Add Selection Colors**,
  **Add from Document** and **Clear** change it.

## Editing a palette {#palette-editor}

[[menu.window > menu.window.color_palettes > menu.window.palette_editor]] opens
the palette editor. **Edit Palette...** in a palette's menu, or a double-click
on the palette outside its colors, opens it on that palette.

![The Palette Editor](../../img/color-palettes-palette-editor.png)

1. Choose the [[dialog.palette]] to edit, or click [[dialog.new_palette]] to
   start one.
2. Type its [[dialog.name]].
3. Click a color to select it. <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+click adds a color to the
   selection or takes it away, <kbd>Shift</kbd>+click selects every color
   from the last one clicked. [[dialog.add_color]] adds a color and
   [[dialog.remove_color]] (or the <kbd>Delete</kbd> key) deletes every
   selected color at once. **Move up** and **Move down** move the selected
   colors, and you can drag a color to another place. With one color
   selected, type its name or click its swatch to change it. **Undo** takes
   back the last change.
4. Tick [[dialog.spot_color]] to make the selected color a spot color: a
   named ink, printed on a plate of its own under the color's name, with the
   color as its stand-in on screen. PDF exports keep it as a separate ink.
5. Click [[dialog.save_palette]] to save it as a file.
6. Click [[dialog.ok]], or **Apply** to keep the changes and go on editing.
   **Cancel** (or <kbd>Esc</kbd>) leaves the palette as it was: palettes are
   not part of a drawing, so this is the way to undo changes to them.

Built-in palettes cannot be edited; make a new palette, or edit a copy.
